## **ADA ESSAY**

1. ### **Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far**? 

I’m a Microbiologist with a certification in Biotechnology Lab Specialist. During my career, I was exposure to biology software that was very important to my work. All of these software and tools that I used helped me to design vectors and primers in order to do biology’s experiments in the lab. 
The programming exposure that I had was basically a mix of programs and software, including: Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, Snap Gene, Blast database ,and flow cytometry software. Currently, I’m taking some Codeacademy free tutorials for HTML and CSS. Also, I completed Jump Start Tutorial. My goal is to learn and get programming knowledge that help me to become more proficient in software development and help people with their daily needs.

My goal in the next five years is working in the tech sector as a developer. In ADA, I see a great opportunity to learn and develop new programming skills. I see myself in five years as a Senior Software  getting more professional knowledge, experience, working with more expertise ,and helping to solve problems that the retail industry is facing.

Ada’s mission, vision and inclusivity statements takes into account software developers in current times. Today, most of the technology companies are dominated by men; however, many tech companies are making an effort to recruit more women for technology jobs and offer equal opportunities. Ada offers a great opportunity to increase diversity in the tech sector by preparing women who want to grow as a software developers. I’m a person who believe in tolerant and respect. I had the opportunity to live in different countries ,and I’m the first of my family to live in the United States. This experience has allowed to be open-minded and share my own culture as well as learn from others. With the values of respect, tolerance, determination and the work ethic to obtain my goals, I believe that I can contribute ADA’s vision for an inclusive and diverse community. I’m excited to potentially be part of this program that supports people with different backgrounds and shows that women can have equal roles and opportunities.  

4.  ### **Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently**?


When I was doing my clinical practice, I was in charge of specimen collection. Every kind of sample must be collected, labeled, and submitted properly. I had to collect a blood sample for a routine hematology test (study of the blood cell) in a purple tube that contain a special anticoagulant (Na-EDTA) for this test. I made a mistake, and I collected the blood in a different tube’s color without anticoagulant. When I was running the test, I realize that I made a mistake. Therefore, I needed to solve this problem. I called the patient again and explained the situation and my mistake. After  this experience, I learned to be more aware and double check my work after every specimen collection. I even created a checklist to  use as reference to make sure that I collected each sample  correctly. This situation not only helped me to increase my concentration and attention to detail, but it also helped me to implement my own procedure to ensure sample collection accuracy.
